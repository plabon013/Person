1.	Get User Data:
•	Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to fetch a list of users.
•	For each user, grab their name, username, email, and ID.
2.	Show User Info:
•	Make a card for each user with their name, username, and email displayed.
3.	Add Robot Avatars:
•	Use each user’s ID to get a cat avatar from https://robohash.org/.
•	For example, for a user with ID 1, the avatar URL would be https://robohash.org/1.
4.	Put Everything on the Page:
•	Show the user info and cat avatars in a grid on the webpage.
5.	Upload to a Server:
•	Once the page is done, upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web server, so others can view your page live. You can use any web hosting service you’re comfortable with (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other service).
